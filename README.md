<b>You will need:</b>
- your own FiveM Server (ESX) e.g. files from: https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/
MYG Coin Plugin works with the standard template (ESX / txAdmin). Latest successful test with: Build 5733

- the MYG Coin Plugin from https://github.com/MyGCoin/MYG-FiveM-Script/
- MySQL / php MyAdmin Database and for FiveM the „mysql-async“ Plugin https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async

You will need to know how to setup a FiveM Server, how to handle a Database like MySQL via phpMyAdmin and (optional) to code in php or any other language. 

<b>How to install the Script:</b>

1. Place the MYGcoin Plugin into your FiveM Resource-Folder (e.g. ...fivem/txData/Server/resources/MYGcoin)
2. Make sure to start the Plugin in your Server Config File with: "Start MYGcoin"
3. Import the MYGcoin.sql to your Database
